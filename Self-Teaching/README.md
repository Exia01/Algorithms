Tailored challenges videos from the "Algorithms and Data Structures Udemy Course" 

The algorithms are divided in --two-- or even --three-- diffent approches. 

There is the 'Simple' solution:
    - May or may not be the most optimized way of doing it.
    - It is also the first attempt to solving the algorithm

There is the 'Refractor' solution:
    - This is the most optimized way(as far as my understading goes) of solving that particular algorithm.
