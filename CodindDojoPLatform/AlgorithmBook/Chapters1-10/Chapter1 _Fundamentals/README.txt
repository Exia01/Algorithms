Challenges:

Biggie Size:
    - Given an array, write a function that changes all positive numbers in the array to "big"
    - Example: makeItBig([-1,3,5,-5]) # [-1,'big', 'big', -5]

Print Low, Return High 
    - Create a function that takes an array of numbers
    - The function should print the lowest value in the array, and return the highest value in the array 

Print One, Return Another
    - Build a function that takes an array of numbers The function should print the second-to-last value in the array, and return the first -odd- value in the array

Double Vision
    - Given array, create a function to return a new array where each value in the original has been double
    - Double([1,2,3]) --> [2,4,6] not changing the original

Count Positives
    - Given array of numbers, create a function to replace last value with a number of positive values
    - Example: countPositives([-1,1,1,1]) --> [-1,1,1,3]

Even and Odds
    - Create a function that accepts an array. Every time that array has three odd values in a row, print "That's odd"
    - Every time the array has three evens in a row, print "even more so!" 

Increment the seconds
    - given array, add 1 to ood elements([1], [3])

Previous Lengths
    - You are passed an array containing strings.
    - working within the same, replace each string with a number - the length of the string at previous array index and return the array.
