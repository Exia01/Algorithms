-- Generally, the functions have the challenge name --

Challenges:

Biggie Size:
    - Given an array, write a function that changes all positive numbers in the array to "big"
    - Example: makeItBig([-1,3,5,-5]) # [-1,'big', 'big', -5]

Print Low, Return High 
    - Create a function that takes an array of numbers
    - The function should print the lowest value in the array, and return the highest value in the array 

Print One, Return Another
    - Build a function that takes an array of numbers The function should print the second-to-last value in the array, and return the first -odd- value in the array

Double Vision
    - Given array, create a function to return a new array where each value in the original has been double
    - Double([1,2,3]) --> [2,4,6] not changing the original

Count Positives
    - Given array of numbers, create a function to replace last value with a number of positive values
    - Example: countPositives([-1,1,1,1]) --> [-1,1,1,3]

Even and Odds
    - Create a function that accepts an array. Every time that array has three odd values in a row, print "That's odd"
    - Every time the array has three evens in a row, print "even more so!" 

Increment the seconds
    - given array, add 1 to ood elements([1], [3])

Previous Lengths
    - You are passed an array containing strings.
    - working within the same, replace each string with a number - the length of the string at previous array index and return the array. 

Adding Seven to Most
    - Build a function that accepts an array
    - Return a new array with all values except firs, adding 7 to each. 
    - Do not alter the original array

Reverse Array
    - Given array, write a function to reverse values, in place.
    - Example: reverseArray([3,1,6,4,2])
        - returns same array, containing [2,4,6,1,3]

Outlook:Negative 
    - Given an array, create and return a new one containing all the values provided array Negative
    - Can't just multiply by -1 
    - Given [1,-3, 5], return [-1,-3,-5]

Always Hungry
    - Create a function that accepts an array
    - It then prints "yummy" each time the values is equal to "food".
    - If no array elements are "food" then print "Im hungry" once

Swap towards the center
    - Given array, swap first and last, third and third to last, etc.
    - input [true, 42,"Ada", 2, "Pizza"]
    - Will become ["Pizza", 42, "Ada", 2, true]
    - Change[1,2,3,4,5,6] to [6,2,4,3,5,1]

Scale Array
     - Function takes an array "arr" and number "num"
     - Multiply each arr value by num and return the changed arr.
